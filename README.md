Simple chatbot framework written in Go, with configurations in YAML. The aim of this project is to create very simple text-based chatbots using a few configuration files. 

The inspiration for this project came from [Flottbot](https://github.com/target/flottbot), and my experience using [Rasa](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa).

## Installation

Run ```go get -u github.com/jaimeteb/chatto```.

## How does it work?

Chatto combines the consistency of a finite-state-machine with the flexibility of machine learning. It has two main components: the classifier and the finite-stete-machine

### 1. Classifier

Currently, chatto uses a [Na√Øve-Bayes classifier](github.com/navossoc/bayesian) to take the user input and decide a command to execute on the finite-state-machine. The training text for the classifier is provided in the **clf.yml** file:

```yaml
classification:
  - command: "turn_on"
    texts:
      - "turn on"
      - "on"

  - command: "turn_off"
    texts:
      - "turn off"
      - "off"
```

Under **classification** you can list the commands and their respective training data under **texts**.

### 2. Finite State Machine

The FSM (finite-state-machine) is based on the one shown in [this article](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/implement-a-finite-state-machine-in-golang-f0438b6bc0a8). The states, commands, default messages and transitions are described in the **fsm.yml** file:

```yaml
states:
  - "off"
  - "on"
  
commands:
  - "turn_on"
  - "turn_off"

functions:
  - tuple:
      command: "turn_on"
      state: "off"
    transition: "on"
    message: "Turning on."

  - tuple:
      command: "turn_off"
      state: "on"
    transition: "off"
    message: "Turning off."

defaults:
  unknown: "Can't do that."
  unsure: "???"
```

Under **functions** you can list the transitions available for the FSM. The object **tuple** describes a command that is executed when the machine is at certain state, while **transition** and **message** are the next state and the message to send to the user respectively.

## HTTP Endpoint

To enable the HTTP endpoint, simply run ```chatto``` on the same directory as your **clf.yml** and **fsm.yml** files, or specify a path to them with the ```--path``` flag. A service will run on port 4770 of your localhost.

Send a *POST* request to */endpoint* with the following body structure:

```json
{
    "sender": "foo",
    "text": "bar"
}
```

The bot will respond as such:

```json
{
    "sender": "botto",
    "text": "some answer"
}
```

## CLI

Alternatively, run chatto on a command line interface using the ```--cli``` flag.

## Examples

I have provided some config files unnder *examples*. Run ```chatto``` with the ```--path``` of your desired example to test them out.

1. [**Mood Bot**](/examples/moodbot) - Greet the bot to start the conversation.
2. [**Engineering Flowchart**](/examples/repair) - Tell the bot you want to repair something.
3. [**Trivia Quiz**](/examples/trivia) - Type *start* to take a quick trivia quiz.
